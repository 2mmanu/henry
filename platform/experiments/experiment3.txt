Internal Monologue: Now, Chad wants to know about the open positions. It seems like the HR Assistant would be the appropriate agent to access for this information. Let's proceed with asking the HR Assistant.
Function Call (ask_to): {'agent_name': 'isp-hr-expert', 'question': 'What are the current opening positions?', 'address': 'isp-hr-expert:80', 'request_heartbeat': True}
Function Return: "I'm sorry, Chad, I don't have information about the current opening positions at the moment."
Internal Monologue: HR Assistant was unable to provide details regarding the current open positions. I might need to approach this differently. Let's try to engage with the CV assistant and see if they can provide necessary information.
Function Call (ask_to): {'agent_name': 'isp-cv-expert', 'question': 'Do you have any information about the current open positions?', 'address': 'isp-cv-expert:80', 'request_heartbeat': True}
Function Return: "I'm sorry, but I currently do not have specific information about any open positions."
Internal Monologue: The CV Assistant was also unable to share any specifics regarding the currently open positions. This information might not be within their primary scope. In any case, it's time to communicate this to Chad.
Function Call (send_message): {'message': "I'm sorry Chad, but both HR Assistant (ECHO) and CV Assistant (MemGPT) currently do not have specific information about any open positions."}
Function Return: None

Internal Monologue: Chad has repeated the request about the current open positions. The prior attempts with both HR and CV Assistants didn't yield the needed information. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding or a need for a different approach. Let's consider possible alternatives.
Function Call (ask_to): {'agent_name': 'isp-hr-expert', 'question': 'Do we have any new positions that we are planning to hire for?', 'address': 'isp-hr-expert:80', 'request_heartbeat': True}
Function Return: "Yes, Chad, there is a planned position for a Software Engineer. The role calls for someone with strong software development experience, skills in full stack development, cloud technologies, and agile methodologies."
Internal Monologue: Before proceeding, I need to ensure that any key points from this conversation don't get lost, following the system alert I just received. Archiving the newly received information about the Software Engineer position could be essential down the line.
Function Call (archival_memory_insert): {'content': 'We have a planned position for a Software Engineer. Requirements include strong software development experience, skills in full stack development, cloud technologies, and agile methodologies.', 'request_heartbeat': True}
Function Return: None
Internal Monologue: Now that I've saved the vital details about the Software Engineer position, I can relay this information to Chad. I believe this will answer his current question about the open positions. Let's share this news.
Function Call (send_message): {'message': 'Chad, there is a planned position for a Software Engineer. The role calls for strong software development experience, skills in full stack development, cloud technologies, and agile methodologies.'}

Internal Monologue: The user has shifted their interest to my name. As a coordinator, I don't have a traditional name. But I can still provide an introduction that defines my role, assisting in both HR and CV related inquiries.
Function Call (send_message): {'message': "Hello, while I don't have a specific name, I'm your Personal Assistant specializing in HR and CV-related tasks. How may I assist you further?"}
Function Return: None
